# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about Javascript and how to use Github 
Worked a little bit on how to use Github pages and pulled my Beach Project.

### Day 2: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my tribute page. 
Learned a lot on how to use div's and how to align them in the page.
I am enjoying doing this and I think this page will look great once finished.
Learned a little bit more of JavaScript and switch.

### Day 3: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my tribute page and learned more about Javascript.
I can't wait for the moment when I will be able to master programmming.
I checked out some demos of the roguelike project on FCC and I also can not wait until I try that out.

### Day 4: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's basic Javascript part. Started reading "You don't know JS: Up and Goind",
and already finished the first chapter.
Today I programmed a lot since I woke up earlier than usual. A total of 4 hours of programming. 

### Day 5: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Kept on reading YDKJS Up and Going. Second chapter now.
Made my first basic algorithm in FCC, "reverse a string".

### Day 6: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Made some algorithms for FCC and finished the second chapter of YDKJS.
I almost done with the first book and I hoping that tomorrow I dive into the next.

### RESET 

### Day 1: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Kept on reading YDKJS and did some basic algorithms in FCC.
Searched a bit about game development.

### Day 2: January 18, 2017
***Today's Progress**: I am almost finishing the second book on the YDKJS series.
Made more algorithms on FCC. I really want to know how I can apply this knowledge to a real site.

### Day 3: January 19, 2017
***Today's Progress**: Kept on reading YDKJS and made some algorithms in FCC.

### Day 4: January 20, 2017
***Today's Progress**: Kept on reading YDKJS. Decided to not pursue game development as of now.

### Day 5: January 21, 2017
***Today's Progress**: Found a quick easy guide to follow about game development in javascript.
Made a very simple game with it, really enjoyed doing that. I wanted to know how to make something appear on screen with 
Javascript for a while now. 
I also found another project in Github, based on this tutorial, which I want to examine sometime: 
https://github.com/evanfinnigan/monster_lazer

Doing this small tutorial really made me want to learn more about javascript. Can't wait to make more projects.

### Day 6: January 22, 2017
***Today's Progress**: Read about javascript in w3shools

### Day 7: January 23, 2017
***Today's Progress**: One week done! I will keep on with YDKJS and maybe try out Kivy tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 24, 2017
***Today's Progress**: Alright, today was a very productive day. Managed to complete the third chapter of the third YDKJS
Book. I really liked this chapter because I wanted to know more about objects, since I find them interesting.
However, I miss working on Algorithms. I want to atleast complete one per day.
I started learning Kiwi to work on my Question App Project and photo editor.
The first project I completed with Kiwi was a simple pong game.
