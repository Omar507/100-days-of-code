<img src="bill-gates-jpg.jpg" id="picture"> 
<p class="basictext">Full name: William Henry "Bill" Gates III </p>
<p class="basictext">Date of birth: 28 October, 1955 </p>
<div id="text" align="justify">
	<p class="basictext" style="margin: 0px;">Best known for: Being the co-founder of Microsoft and the richest man in the world. 
	Gates is also a philanthropist and is known for his charitable work in Africa, 
	particularly his efforts to eradicate diseases such as Polio. </p>
	<p class="basictext"style="font-size: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px"> Here is a quick time line of Bill Gates' life: </p>
	<p class="basictext" style="margin-top: 0px;" ><b>1978:</b> After eight weeks of programming night and day in early 1975, Bill Gates, 20,
	and Paul Allen complete a version of BASIC for the Altair 8800 microcomputer. 
	By July they’d licensed the product, and in November they came up with a name for their new partnership: 
	MicroSoft. </p>
	<p class="basictext"><b>1985: </b> Relocating to Bellevue, Wash., and hiring Steve Ballmer to handle managerial duties were
	two of the smartest moves Gates made in the 1980s. But putting Microsoft’s Disk Operating System (DOS) on IBM’s new Personal
	Computer was the true start of the company’s entry into the heart of every PC to come. By 1985, when Gates was 30, Microsoft 
	had 910 employees and more than $140 million in revenues.</p>
	<p class="basictext"><b>1994: </b> Gates becomes the richest man in America at 38, with a fortune of $9.35 billion. 
	With more than 25 million licensed copies of the Windows operating system in use, Microsoft begins its push into the
	mainstream consumer market, and sales hit $3.7 billion. By this year, 
	even Wal-Mart sells Microsoft software in its aisles. </p>
	<p class="basictext"><b>2006: </b>Gates, 49, announces his intention to depart in 2008 from helping out with day-to-day
	activities at Microsoft in order to devote full attention to the philanthropic foundation he operates along with his wife,
	Melinda. The decision comes with Microsoft stock at a four-year low of $22, but Gates remains the richest man in the world
	, with a fortune of $51 billion. </p>
	
	<p class="basictext"> "Ultimately, the PC will be a window to everything people are interested 
						in-and everything we need to know." <i>-Bill Gates</i></p>
